# This repository contains unsupervised learning models worked on the following datasets:

## 1) Iris dataset

#### The attributes are:

    1) sepal_length    
    2) sepal_width    
    3) petal_length    
    4) petal_width    
    5) species 
    
#### The classification algorithm applied are:

    1) Hierarchial clustering    
    2) K-means
    
See notebook for Hierarchial clustering [here](https://github.com/jayashree8/Machine_learning_unsupervised_models/blob/master/Iris%20hierarchial%20clustering/iris%20hierarchical%20clustering.ipynb)

See notebook for K-means [here](https://github.com/jayashree8/Machine_learning_unsupervised_models/blob/master/Iris%20K-means/iris%20k%20means.ipynb)

## 2) Loan dataset

#### Here are what the columns represent:

* credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
* purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").
* int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.
* installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
* log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
* dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).
* fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.
* days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
* revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
* revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).
* inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
* delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
* pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).
    
#### The classification algorithm applied are:

    1) Hierarchial clustering    
    2) K-means

## 3) Mall customers dataset

#### The attributes are:
    1) CustomerID
    2) Genre
    3) Age
    4) Annual Income (k$)
    5) Spending Score (1-100)

#### The classification algorithm applied are:

    1) Hierarchial clustering    
    2) K-means
